#Slide Maker#
##A tool, that makes presentation slides out of MD files##
Create an MD file and split it with horizontal ruler markup (`---`). What is between two rulers is considered a slide. Process that MD file through Slide Maker and you'll get an HTML file with all necessary styling and functionality to use it as a presentation. Add your own CSS styles and you can make awesome custom presentations, that run in a browser.
