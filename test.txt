## Why?
Can you imagine, that you will need to write down just few lines of text and by using some tool a whole presentation will be created to be viewed in browser?
##### I want _that_
---
##This is it
* It will take your pseudo-markdown text
+ Parse it and create an [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) page
- Decorate that page with default [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (or your custom one)

* Give it some basic functionality (moving through slides)
* **Voila!** Presentation is __ready__

##How was this done?
---
## For starters...
1. *a lot* of RegExs
2. some `code`
---
Then some more code like this
    matrix.init();
    let neo = matrix.createTheOne();
    neo.learn("Kung fu");
